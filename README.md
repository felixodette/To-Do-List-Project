# To-Do-List
# webpack-template

"To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete. You will build a simple website that allows for doing that, and you will do it using ES6 and Webpack!

You will build a very simple yet powerful to-do list. It will be inspired by the minimalist website.
